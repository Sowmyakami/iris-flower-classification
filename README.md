- 📊 Data loading and visualization
- 🤖 Training three classifiers: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree
- 📈 Model evaluation using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix
- 🏆 Decision Tree identified as the best-performing model

## 📁 Files
- `iris_classification.ipynb`: Complete notebook with code, visuals, and results

## 🧠 Skills Practiced
- Data manipulation with pandas
- Visual exploration with seaborn and matplotlib
- Machine learning with scikit-learn
- Performance analysis and interpretation

## 🚀 Next Steps
